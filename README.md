Buzzword Replacerator
=====================

A Google Chrome extension to replace buzzwords with more accurate words.

Installation
------------

One day I will become unlazy and submit this to the Chrome Store. Until then, you can install 
this extension by checking out the code, turning "Developer Mode" on under Chrome Extensions, 
and clicking "Load Unpacked Extension". From there, select the "src" folder and enable this goodness.
